Read the skill definition at `skills/observable-gepa-optimizer/SKILL.md` and all its referenced files in `use-cases/` and `references/` to understand the full context.

Then help the user based on their needs:
- If they have existing DSPy GEPA code, follow `use-cases/migration.md`
- If they have labelled data but no code, follow `use-cases/create-from-scratch.md` interactively

Start by asking the user which use case applies to them, or if they've already indicated their use case, proceed directly.
